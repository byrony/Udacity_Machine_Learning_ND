This project requires Python 3.6 with the Jupyter Notebook, and the libraries below: 

pandas, 

numpy,

matplotlib

sci-kit learn, 

seaborn,

XGBoost,

Keras

__Note:__

The script in `xgboost_final_model.ipynb` need read the processed data `train_clear.csv` and `test_clear.csv`. Those two files are too large to upload to github. They can be generated by the script in `create_new_features.ipynb`.
